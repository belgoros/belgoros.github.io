        <p>
          I am a Senior Software Engineer living in Belgium, having previously spent
          over 20 years as a Software Engineer at Capgemini Engineering, Altran,
          Devoteam, GFI Informatique (now Inetum), Atos, and AubayPromotic which
          gave me good experience either working in a team of up to 100 persons or
          alone and directly with a product owner or final users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am hungry for learning, and self-improvement and always willing to
          accept constructive criticism, I can work as both a self-guided team
          member and project team leader. I enjoy creating great products with great
          user experiences and working in a dynamic environment focusing on good
          development practices, automation, and shipping small, frequent releases.
