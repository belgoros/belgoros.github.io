			I am a Senior Software Engineer leaving In Belgium and working at Capgemini Engineering, having previously spent over 15 years as a Software Engineer at Devoteam, GFI Informatique (now Inetum), Atos and Aubay.Promotic what gave me a good experience either to work in team of up to 100 persons or alone and directly with a product owner or final users. <br/><br/>
      I am a hunger for learning, self improvement and always have a willingness to accept constructive criticism, able to
      work as both a self guided team member or project team leader. I enjoy creating great products with great user experiences and working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation and shipping small, frequent releases.
